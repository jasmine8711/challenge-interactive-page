                The Belgian national football team[C] has officially represented Belgium in international football since
                their maiden match in 1904. The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and is governed in Europe
                by
                UEFAâ€”both of which were co-founded by the Belgian team's supervising body, the Royal Belgian Football
                Association (RBFA).
                Periods of regular Belgian representation at the highest international level, from 1920 to 1938, from
                1982
                to
                2002 and again from 2014 onwards, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds.Most of
                Belgium's home matches are played at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.

                With qualification to the knockout stage already assured, two second-string sides laboured in a low-key
                encounter where three points to seal top spot - and a seemingly tougher route through the tournament -
                appeared a dubious prize
